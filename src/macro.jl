    @fread f [ rec=N ] [ spec ... ]

Macro interface for reading data from the `FortranFile` `f`.
A single `@fread` call will process a single data record from the file.
Each `spec` can be:
* a `var::T` declaration, which will read data of the type `T` from the
  file, and assign it to the variable `var`. `T` can be one of the usual
  Fortran scalar datatypes.
* a `var::(T,dims...)` declaration, where `T` is a scalar datatype and
  `dims...` is a series of integers. This reads an array of the specified
  datatype and dimensions, and assigns it to the variable `var`.
* `var::Array{T}(undef,dims...)` as an explicit form for reading arrays
* a variable name, which must refer to a pre-allocated array.
Note that a `spec` can refer to variables assigned by previous specs.
The `rec` keyword must be given iff `f` refers to a direct-access file,
and specifies which record to read.


Example:

    @fread f n::Int32 x::(Float64,n)

This reads a single `Int32`, assigns it to `n`, and then reads a `Float64` array
with `n` elements and assigns it to `x`. Such a record can not be processed by
the function-based `read` interface. The equivalent call would be

    n, x = read(f, Int32, (Float64,n))

but this can't work because `n` is only assigned after the `read` statement is
processed. The macro interface is provided to cover such cases.
